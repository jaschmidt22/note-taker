# Note Taker

## Description

I was given the task of creating a note taking application that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses Express.js on the back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. While making this project I learned how to use Express.js (called middleware) to handle HTTP request-response cycles.

## Usage

To use this application, be sure to download and install node.js. Specifically, the Express.js package included in node.js is required to run this application. I have deployed the app with Heroku and here is the link:
